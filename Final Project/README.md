A friend's grandmother regularly knits socks. But she spends way too much money on wool at the craft shop next door. Therefore, you want to programme a comparison portal for her (and all knitting grannies). The portal should display wool-knitting infor-mation from different websites.

To do so, you want to start by automatically reading information from a website, (https://yarnplaza.com ).

You are interested in the price, the delivery time, the needle size and the composition. 
Also, remember to round the price found for each product to the nearest whole number.
You have selected the following billets for which you want to have the information.
Brand		Name
DMC		Natura XL
Drops		Safran
Stylecraft	Special dk
If you want to invest more time, you can also try to save the information not only in a file, but e.g., also store it in a database or display it in the browser.

Python Ghana wants to create a dashboard for monitoring COVID-related data. You are tasked to build a terminal(cmd) dashboard.
Dataset is 'PA_singlestate_timeseries.csv'.

At a minimum, Your interface should display the following (refer to image below):
1. Overview of the dataset
	A general description of what's in this dataset. Use at most 3 sentences.
	The number of duplicate entries (i.e., exact matching rows) in this dataset. You do not need to do any manipulation on the data.
2. COVID information on the day of January, 3rd, 2022.
	State name.
	Today's date (a.k.a. January, 3rd, 2022)
	Cumulative confirmed or suspected cases.
	Cumulative deaths that are suspected or confirmed.
	New cases.
	New deaths.
	Cases per 100k population calculated using a 7-day rolling average.
	Ratio of population that has completed vaccination.
	Ratio of population that has initiated vaccination.
3. Graph the relationship between actual Covid cases and vaccinations completed. Are there any salient trends or strong relationships? For which time periods do these trends exist? Please share your key findings and attach your graph with Covid cases as the x-axis. Your graph should be easy to understand.
